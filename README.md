# Live-Grid-With-Asp.net-Core-2.2-SignalR

This is a live grid with signalR.

I used [Bootstrap Table](https://bootstrap-table.com/) to show data in a table. It is a powerfull library with many useful methods and abilities.

### Usage

After open the project add migration to seed data initialize database, then update database
```sh
add-migration name
update-database
```

Then run the project and enjoye ;)
